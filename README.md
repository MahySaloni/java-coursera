# Java Course Practice

This repository contains the Java code I wrote while completing a course on Java programming on Coursera. The files include exercises, practice problems, and mini-projects that helped me learn core Java concepts such as:

- Variables and Data Types  
- Control Flow (if, switch, loops)  
- Functions and Recursion  
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism)  
- Exception Handling  
- Arrays and Collections  
- File I/O  
- Basic Java APIs

These code samples serve as a personal reference and showcase my progress through the course.
