System.out.println(years[n]); - Prints the element in nth position, where n starts from 0. 
The first element of the array is accessed with index 0. If the length of the array is m, the index position last element of the array is m-1. 
In the case of the example used here, the length of the array is 6 and the index of the last element is 5. */
